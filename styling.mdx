# Tailwind, Sass and CSS 

## CSS

CSS is enough to style a website, set defaults and add global styles to HTML semantic elements, 

Use classes to style particular items in the page, 

## Sass

Sass will come in handy as the website grows, organize styles into files, use mixins to reduce repition, and type things faster, the compiler puts everything in place and generates a single CSS file for the website

## Tailwind

Tailwind provides a huge and flexible set of classes that allows inline styling with the code, it helps build a site very fast.

Drawbacks: it is not scalable! as the site grows, styles will repeat in many components, so using SASS will be a better decision to remove repetition and implementing uniform styles accross many components

## Modules

Apply for the module, allows class names to repeat without overlaping

## Styled components

Create styles for the component itself
