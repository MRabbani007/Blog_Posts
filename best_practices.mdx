# Best Practices

Web dev best practices

## SOLID
SOLID is an acronym that stands for:
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The single responsibility principle states that a class, module, or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should do one thing.

### The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
The open-closed principle states that classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The principle states that child classes or subclasses must be substitutable for their parent classes or super classes. In other words, the child class must be able to replace the parent class. This has the advantage of letting you know what to expect from your code.

### The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The interface segregation principle states that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces or methods they do not use.

More specifically, the ISP suggests that software developers should break down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, so that clients only need to depend on the interfaces that are relevant to them. This can make the codebase easier to maintain.

### The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The dependency inversion principle is about decoupling software modules. That is, making them as separate from one another as possible.

## DRY
DRY, which stands for ‘don’t repeat yourself,’ is a principle of software development that aims at reducing the repetition of patterns and code duplication in favor of abstractions and avoiding redundancy.
