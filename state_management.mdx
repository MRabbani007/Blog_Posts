# React Context & Redux

## State Management

Storing Data on the client side and sharing data between components.

As the number of components in our application increases it becomes difficult to pass state as props to multiple components. To overcome this situation we use state management tools

### Prop Drilling

Prop drilling is a term used in React to describe the process of passing data from a part of a component tree to another part by going through other components that do not necessarily need the data, but only pass it down the tree.

To avoid prop drilling, you can use Reactâ€™s Context API or state management libraries like Redux which allow you to access the state from anywhere in your component tree without having to pass it down through every level.

## React Context

Context API is used to pass global variables anywhere in the code. It helps when there is a need for sharing state between a lot of nested components. It is light in weight and easier to use, to create a context just need to call React.createContext(). It eliminates the need to install other dependencies or third-party libraries like redux for state management. It has two properties Provider and Consumer. 

A provider is used to provide context to the whole application whereas a consumer consume the context provided by nearest provider. In other words The Provider acts as a parent it passes the state to its children whereas the Consumer uses the state that has been passed. 

## Redux Toolkit and RTK Query

React-redux is a state management tool which makes it easier to pass these states from one component to another irrespective of their position in the component tree and hence prevents the complexity of the application.

They are several benfits of using react-redux such as:

1. It provides centralized state management i.e. a single store for whole application
2. It optimizes performance as it prevents re-rendering of component
3. Makes the process of debugging easier
4. Since it offers persistent state management therefore storing data for long times become easier

There are four fundamental concepts of redux in react which decide how the data will flow through components

1. Redux Store: It is an object that holds the application state
2. Action Creators: These are functions that return actions (objects)
3. Actions: Actions are simple objects which conventionally have two properties- type and payload 
4. Reducers: Reducers are pure functions that update the state of the application in response to actions

Selectors: read state of redux store

### Disadvantages
Redux adds boilerplate to the app, not suitable for smaller apps

Note: Redux not used with NextJS
