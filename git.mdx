# Git & Github

## Version Control

## Life Cycle
1. Initiate Git: add git to project
```
git init
```

2. check status
```
git status
```

3. Stage: add files
When you stage changes, Git takes a snapshot of the files at that moment in time. This snapshot includes all of the changes you've made since the last commit.

Staging changes allows you to carefully review your changes before committing them. You can stage changes in small chunks and commit them separately, or stage all changes and commit them together. 

```
git add .
```

4. Commit: commit current changes
This creates a new snapshot of your repository with the changes you made.

``` 
git commit -m "message"
```

5. Add a remote repository
By adding a remote repository, you establish a connection between your local repository and the remote repository, allowing you to push and pull changes between them.

```
git remote add origin repository_URL
```

6. Push: Push to remote
This uploads your changes to a shared repository that others can access.

```
git push -u default_branch
```

7. Pull
The git pull command fetches the latest changes made by other contributors from a remote repository and automatically merges them into the current branch.

## Collaboration
1. Cloning
Cloning creates a local copy of a remote repository, including all the files and history of the project.

```
git clone repository_URL
```

2. Branching
Create new branch

```
git branch branch_name
```

To switch to the new branch
```
git checkout branch_name
```

or join the above steps:
```
git checkout -b branch_name
```

3. Merging
```
git merge
```

## 
Restore
Delete

## Gitignore
create a file ".gitignore" with the files and folders to be ignored

Directory names (for example, node_modules/, dist/, build/)
File extensions (for example, *.log, *.tmp, .env)
Specific files (for example, secrets.txt, config.ini)
