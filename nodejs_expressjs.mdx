# NodeJS & ExpressJS

## NodeJS

## ExpressJS

Express is a small framework that sits on top of Node.js’s web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing; it adds helpful utilities to Node.js’s HTTP objects; it facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.

The main reason for choosing Express is its simplicity, minimalism, flexibility, and scalability characteristics. It provides easy setup for middlewares and routing.

```
const express = require('express'); 
const app = express(); 
const PORT = 8000; 
  
app.get('/', (req, res) => { 
  res.send('Hello World!'); 
}); 
  
app.listen(PORT, () => { 
  console.log(`Server is listening at port :${PORT}`); 
}); 
```

### Features

1. Routing: Express provides a simple way to define routes for handling HTTP requests. Routes are used to map different URLs to specific pieces of code, making it easy to organize your application’s logic.
2. Middleware: Express uses middleware functions to perform tasks during the request-response cycle. Middleware functions have access to the request, response, and the next middleware function.
3. HTTP Utility Methods: Express mainly used for handling HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This makes it easy to define how the application should respond to different types of HTTP requests.
4. Static File Serving: It can also serve static files, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of built-in express.static middleware.
5. Security: It includes features and middleware to strengthen the security of your web applications, such as the helmet middleware to secure your app.

### Structure

**Entry point:** This is the starting point of the application where you set up your server, connect to your database, add middleware, and define the main routes.
**Routes directory:** This directory contains files for the app’s routes.
**Controllers directory:** This directory contains files that define the logic to handle requests for a specific route.
**Models directory:** This directory is used for creating the schema models for the different data.
**Middleware directory:** This directory contains custom middleware functions that you can use in your routes.
**Views directory:** If you’re using a templating engine, this directory contains your view templates.
**Public directory:** This directory contains static files that are served directly by the server such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

### Tools & libraries

There are many tools and libraries that can be integrated with Express.js such as:

Database tools: MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.
Template Engines: EJS, Pug, Mustache.
Authentication libraries: Passport.js.
Logging libraries: Morgan, Winston.
Validation libraries: Joi, express-validator.
ORM libraries: Sequelize, Mongoose.

### Middleware

There are mainly five types of Middleware in Express.js:

Application-level middleware: Bound to an instance of the Express application and are executed for every incoming request. These middlewares are defined using the app.use() method, and they can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, setting global variables, and more.
Router-level middleware: Specific to a particular router instance.
Error-handling middleware
Built-in middleware
Third-party middleware

Express.js comes with several built-in middleware functions. Few of them are:

express.json: This is used for parsing incoming requests with JSON payloads.
express.static: This is used to serve static files like images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.
express.urlencoded: This is used for parsing incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.
express.raw: This is used for parse incoming requests with a raw body.
express.text: This is used for parse incoming requests with a text body.

Express.js allows you to use third-party middleware to extend and enhance the functionality of your web application. Here are some commonly used third-party middleware in Express.js:

body-parser: This middleware is used to parse incoming request bodies, allowing you to access form data or JSON payloads on req.body.
cors: This module provides middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Express application.
morgan: Morgan is a middleware module that provides request logging functionality.
helmet: Helmet helps to secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. 
express-session: This middleware is used for managing user sessions in your Express application.
passport: This middleware is used for implementing authentication and authorization in Express applications.

### Scaffolding

Scaffolding in Express.js refers to the process of generating a basic project structure automatically. This can speed up the initial setup and help maintain consistency in the way projects are structured, especially in large teams.

Express application generator are used for quickly setting up a new Express application with some basic structure. You can install it using Node Package Manager (npm), which comes with Node.js.

```
npm install -g express-generator
```

and then create and application

```
express-generator app-name
npm install
npm start
```

Yeoman is a scaffolding tool for web applications that helps developers to create new projects by providing a generator-based workflow.

```
npm install -g yo
yo appname
```
